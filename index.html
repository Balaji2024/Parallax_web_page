                Adventure Cycling is a style of cycling that involves taking a long-distance journey, often with a
                specific goal in mind. This type of cycling allows cyclists to explore new places and experience the
                outdoors in a unique way. Adventure Cycling is often self-supported, meaning cyclists carry their own
                gear and supplies and rely on their own physical strength to complete their journey.
                <br> <br>
                Adventure Cycling trips can range from a few days to several months and can take place on paved roads,
                gravel roads, or off-road trails. Common destinations for Adventure Cycling include the countryside,
                mountains, deserts, and coastlines. Many cyclists choose to document their journey by taking photos and
                videos, and sharing their experiences with friends and family.

                Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders. A paraglider is
                an airplane in your backpack. No seriously! It is an aircraft which is powered by the wind and when not
                flying, fits in a backpack easy enough to be carried around. Paragliding is the closest a human being
                can get to the feeling of flying. A paraglider is a simple aircraft with no machines and no fuel, just
                the wind and pilot’s flying skills.

                <br> <br>
                Paragliding equipment comprises a wing or canopy called a ‘paraglider’ made up of two layers of fabric
                made of high-performance non-porous materials such as rip-stop polyester or nylon. The wing is connected
                to a harness with a network of suspended lines made of an immensely strong material like Kevlar. The
                pilot straps on this harness and after a foot launch into the wind is able to sit comfortably in the
                harness and control the flight. Paragliders have just two controls – on the left and right of the pilot
                which are used for turning and as brakes.

                Surfing, sport of riding breaking waves towards the shore, particularly by means of a board. Surfing’s
                roots dwell pre-modern Hawaii and Polynesia, where the game was practiced by both men and women from all
                social strata from royalty to commoners. Organized competitions helped to counter this negative image
                and to win surfing some social respectability. Here is everything you need to know about surfing in
                India.
                <br> <br>
                India’s 7500 kilometre coastline provides several spots for surfboarding. The largest waves are
                typically seen between May and September, the pre-monsoon and monsoon season.
                Waters of India are already well-liked for hosting a range of adventure sports like rafting, kayaking,
                sailing, stream crossing, and plenty of others. One such upcoming sport is Surfing in India.
                The western coast is great for beginners to get acquainted with a surfboard, whereas eastern shores have
                stronger currents and harder wave breakpoints.
